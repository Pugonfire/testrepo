                <p><b>Suppose you have to write an essay. Unanticipated events interfere with your planning and you do not have time to complete your essay. Rather than missing the deadline, you make some superficial changes to an essay that you completed the previous year for a different module, and submit it.
                 
                Was the decision to submit essentially the same essay you have written for another module morally permissible?</b></p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-6">
                I would argue that submitting the same essay for another module is morally permissible under the assumption that the question requirements for both essays are the same or similar (since I have apparently decided that my old essay is fully capable of answering the new question). 

                From a virtue ethics point of view, answering the same question with the same answer is not lazy but a display of conviction. Consider this; two different people ask you for your view on a certain topic, one does not give different answers to the two individuals. To do so would be indicative of a weak personal opinion, one that changes to suit the whims and fancies of different people. If the old essay reflected and still reflects my views on the topic, then it is justifiable to answer with the same answer.
